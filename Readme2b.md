###Assginment 1(Images labeled as Project 2b)###
*I got confused with the naming from another class*
***Khyran Bush***
***Design tool - Moqups***
Primary functions I tried to represent with 1:
* User Friendliness
* Client roster(List of everyone who uses the machine)
* Quantity tables
* Ease of ordering and procuring new medicine
* Ease of notifying customers.
Primary Functions of Image 2:
* Simplistic
* Easy to determine a schedule
* For the common man

What I liked about both:
* Image 1 is for a doctor who needs to control the medicine his patients get and look at the analytics of how much money they are
  spending per order and when they take their medicines.
* Image 2 is for the common person so they can schedule when they want the medicine, How often they would like to recieve more, and the time that they should be reminded to take their medicine.
* ALtogether, Image 1 has a lot more usable data but Image 2 is more straightforward.
